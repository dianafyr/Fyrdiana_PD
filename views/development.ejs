                        <p>1 - The game will start at the kitchen. The player will first spawn at the kitchen and there will be an instruction to 
                        help guide them complete the first puzzle. Only after the first puzzle, the door to the next puzzle will open. A hint will also be given.</p> 
                        <p>2 -  After the kitchen, the player is supposed to complete the rest of the puzzles in the other rooms. </p>
                        <p>3 - The final room will be connected to a puzzle in the hall. The hall will have another 2 puzzles that need to be solved. </p>
                        <p>The puzzle difficulty level gets higher (gets harder) after every puzzle you solve. </p>

                        Key takeaway: During the development of the VR escape room, I encountered several challenges that significantly impacted 
                        both the creative and technical aspects of the project. The first major hurdle was troubleshooting. Debugging errors was 
                        a time-consuming process, often requiring multiple consultations with my lecturer to identify and resolve issues. While 
                        challenging, this repetitive troubleshooting helped me deepen my understanding of the mechanics involved, allowing me to 
                        learn from each mistake and build confidence in practical problem-solvingâ€”an experience far more valuable than mere memorization of techniques.
                        Finding inspiration for the concept itself was another significant challenge. At the outset, I struggled to define a clear theme and direction, 
                        as I grappled with what truly inspired me or would create an engaging VR environment. The process of envisioning and 
                        designing the scene took considerable time, requiring an iterative approach to balance visual appeal and functional interaction 
                        within the escape room. The coding aspect presented additional difficulties, as I had little to no experience in C#. Lacking a 
                        foundational understanding of the language, I often found myself relying on repetitive functions and struggling to adapt my knowledge 
                        effectively. Although I attempted to learn through various resources, including ChatGPT, interpreting and implementing these insights 
                        proved difficult. Ultimately, collaborating with classmates helped me bridge the gap in understanding and expand my skill set in C#, enabling 
                        me to tackle coding challenges with greater confidence. Overall, these challenges taught me the importance of persistence, resourcefulness, and collaboration in the learning and development process.
